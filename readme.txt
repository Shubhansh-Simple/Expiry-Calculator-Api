  1.) get/
  2.) set/1

By sending "get" request to his endpoint (with your credentails) you can check how many times your software runs till now 
And by seding the "set" request to this endpoint you can increase the no of times you run your software.

Motive to build this END points is as follow:-

I want to count how many times my client run an software build by me by sending the get request to the api in order to recieve the no_of_times varaible.
And each time my client run the software at the end "set" request will be gone to the endpoint in order to increase the no_of_times value.
